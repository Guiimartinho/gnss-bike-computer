"""Write gnssbike.kicad_pcb: the board, with every part placed and every net.

The outline, the stackup, the single mounting hole and the two antenna
keep-outs come from hardware_gnssbike/04-pcb-e-caixa.md. What is new here is
the placement: each part that the document gives a zone to is put in its zone,
and everything else - the decoupling, the pull-ups, the series resistors -
lands on the nearest free slot to the part it belongs to, outside the
keep-outs and off the board edge. Nothing is routed: the tracks are the
owner's job, and this is the board he starts from.

#              ME54BS13 is 12 x 16.5, and its datasheet wants 4 mm clear

    SWDCDC. This is done as follows: keep the connection between the SWDCDC

    A pour under a switching node is capacitance the converter has to charge
    and discharge at its switching frequency, and on a harvester that runs on
    microwatts that is not a detail. So the rectangle that holds the node's
