 * @brief Threads of the services, their watchdog channels and inboxes
 *
 * docs/16-arquitetura-firmware.md, Threads: one thread per service, each
 * with its own 4 s channel on the task watchdog. A service sleeps on its
 * inbox, a k_msgq that zbus listeners fill with copies of the messages it
 * needs, so no event is lost and no buffer is allocated after boot. The
 * wait has a timeout below the watchdog limit, which also gives each service
 * its periodic work.
 *
 * Priorities: a lower number wins. Stack sizes were measured with
 * CONFIG_STACK_USAGE (see the note next to each in docs/05).
